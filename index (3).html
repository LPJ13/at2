      <h1><i>Denmark strait cataract</i></h1>
      <p>In this small world that we the most tallest waterfall that we know is Angel falls, venezuela.But there is a waterfall much bigger than Angel falls.
      The Denmark strait cataract, in Denmark is way taller and bigger than Angel falls.
      But isn't it curious that the oh-so-mighty waterfall does not attract tourists?Well....this waterfall is under the ocean.
      As unbelievable it is, yes it's the truth. But then again, how can a waterfall be under the ocean? 
      The answer to that is that the frigid water from the Nordic seas that flows south meets the warm waters of Irminger sea.
      As the cold, no freezing water from Nordic sea is more denser, it sinks below the warm water and plummets into the huge drop in the ocean floor, creating a downwards flow well over 3.5 million cubic metres per second.</p>
      <h1><i>The Strid</i></h1>
      <p>The Strid is well-known for it's deadly combination of fast current, unbelievable depth and underwater rocks.
      But ignoring the dark history it has on taking the lives of many people who fell into it, the Strid, a deadly strech of river Wharfe  in Yorkshire, UK is an eligible place for picnic lovers.
      The Strid is a part of river Wharfe, which flows from The north of Yorkshire to The south of Yorkshire, is the perfect defenition of pretty but deadly. </p>
      <h1><i>The sunderban delta</i></h1>
      <p>Also known as the largest delta in the world, the sunderban delta is very much famous for its unique mangrove forest.
      It is also a celestial heaven for some endangerd species such as royal bengal tigers, Ganges and Irawadi dolphins, estuarine crocodiles and the critically endangered endemic river terrapin (Batagur baska).
      The tigers living here has developed a unique habit of swimming in saline water and are famous for their man-eating tendencies.</p>
      <h1><i>The Kuroshio tides</i></h1>
      <p>The Kuroshio Current (黒潮), also known as the Black or Japan Current.
or the Black Stream, is a north-flowing, warm ocean current on the west side of the North Pacific Ocean basin.
It was named for the deep blue appearance of its waters. 
Similar to the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic, the Kuroshio is a powerful western boundary current that transports warm equatorial water poleward and forms the western limb of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.
Ongoing research centered around the Kuroshio Current's response to climate change predicts a strengthening in surface flows of this western boundary current which contrasts the preKuroshio tidesdicted changes in the Atlantic Ocean's Gulf Stream.</p>
